# Hello-World
First introduction to GitHub. 

Hello. My name is Jason, and I am new student to computer programming. I'm in my mid 30's, so growing up with computers has made it a bit easier to grasp the concepts of programming. I thouroughly enjoy coding, programming, solving puzzles, and creating projects and programs. I am looking to turn this ventnure into a career path that I can use toi provide for my new and upcoming family. Because, no one wants to be a bartender forever, right?
